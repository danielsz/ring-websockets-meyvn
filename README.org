* Websockets implemented via Ring's websocket protocol

Experimental support for WebSockets in Ring was added in 1.11.0-alpha1. This is a fully fleshed example that shows how to piece everything together. It is available as a template within Meyvn. This repository serves as reference only.

** What are Meyvn templates?

In the area of web development, specifically, there are a lot of moving parts. Things can go wrong. And often do at the beginning. Setting things up, preparing a build pipeline, etc. There is a real cost in starting a project. With a template, that friction can be reduced. Decisions that embody a design philosophy are embedded in the starting template. The user is guaranteed to start on solid ground.

Meyvn offers are a curated set of templates, such as this one, that will you help you get started quickly.
