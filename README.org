* Websockets implemented via Ring's websocket protocol

Experimental support for WebSockets in Ring was added in 1.11.0-alpha1. This is a fully fleshed example that shows how to piece everything together. It is available as a template within Meyvn. This repository serves as reference only.

** What are Meyvn templates?

In the area of web development, specifically, there are a lot of moving parts. Things can go wrong. And often do at the beginning. Setting things up, preparing a build pipeline, etc. There is a real cost in starting a project. With a template, that friction can be reduced. Decisions that embody a design philosophy are embedded in the starting template. The user is guaranteed to start on solid ground.

Meyvn offers are a curated set of templates, such as this one, that will you help you get started quickly.

** Installation for Meyvn users

#+HTML: <img src="meyvn.png"/>

- Type ~myvn~ in the command line 
- Select one of the websocket templates
- Go into the installation directory and open two terminals
- Type ~myvn -a nrepl~ in one and in the other ~myvn -x cljs~
- Connect to the nREPL in emacs (~alt+x meyvn-connect~)
- Launch the backend (~alt+x meyvn-system-go~)
- Direct browser to [[http://localhost:3085][http://localhost:3085]]

** Installation for non-Meyvn users

- Install [[https://danielsz.github.io/meyvn][Meyvn]].
- Go to top of document.

** Points of interest

- Browsers donâ€™t expose the Ping and Pong API defined in the WebSocket protocol. Web devs have to roll their own keepalive mechanism in the application layer. This example shows one possibility (sweet and short) of how to do that.
- With Transit, Clojure data structures, instead of mere bytes or strings, can be exchanged on the socket. This opens the door for routing messages based on keys in maps, etc. Powerful stuff!
